This is an enigma machine. I made most of it in one go, but to go between computers I uploaded it to github.
Feel free to take a look around, but as I am not skilled with github management, please don't make edits.

Basically how an enigma machine works is similar to a caesar cipher, where the key changes with every letter, and the order is not limited to alphabetical.
I used a randomizer so just a single key can be used, rather than creating one for every code wheel.

Thank you for looking into this.
